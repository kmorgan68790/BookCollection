Objectives:
Revise how to integrate public APIs into web projects.

Create Read Update and Delete data in a PostgreSQL Database to persist data.

Goals:
Use the Open Library Covers API to fetch book covers.

Create a database to store books you have read.

Have a way to add new data about books, update previous reviews and delete entries.

Display this information from your database in a website like https://sive.rs/book

Be able to sort your book entries by rating and recency.

Requirements:
1. Database Persistance
Persist data using a PostgreSQL database. [x]

2. Draw a database diagram on draw.io and plan out any relationships/schema. [x]

3. Project Setup
Set up a new Node.js project using Express.js. [x]

Include pg for working with your localhost PostgreSQL database. [x]

Include EJS for templating. [x]

Create a frontend in HTML CSS JS. [x]

Ensure that the project has a structured directory and file organization. [x]

4. API Integration
Implement at least a GET endpoint to interact with your chosen API. [ x]

Use Axios to send HTTP requests to the API and handle responses. [x ]

5. Data Presentation
Design the application to present the book covers from the API and the data in your database a in a user-friendly way. [ x]

Think about how you would allow the user to sort the data from the database. [ ]

6. Error Handling
Ensure that error handling is in place for both your application and any API requests. You can console log any errors, 
but you can also give users any user-relevant errors. [x ]

7. Documentation
Include comments throughout your code to explain your logic. [ x]

Include a Readme.md file that explains how to start your server, what commands are needed to run your code. e.g. npm i  and then nodemon index.js [ ]
